FOR SEEDING THE random NO GENERATOR :
std::srand(std::time(nullptr));
 FOR THE GAME LOOP :

do {
    std::cout << "Enter your guess: ";
    std::cin >> guess;
    attempts++;

    if (guess < secretNumber) {
        std::cout << "Too low! Try again." << std::endl;

        std::cout << "Too high! Try again." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Congratulations! You've guessed the number in " << attempts << " attempts!" << std::endl;
    }
} while (guess != secretNumber);
 FOR THE USER FEEDBACK :
g++ -o guess_game guess_game.cpp
 RUN THE EXECUTABLE :
